# IET Lucknow Semester Timetable

This is the semester timetable maintained in a yaml format. The IETHub
bot refers to this yaml file and posts daily class schedule to all the
students of first year on their Yap chat app.

This is currently available for B.Tech. first year students only. We
will roll this out to other years/courses once respective class
students add their schedule to the `timetable.yml` file.


## There is an error in the timetable, who should I contact to fix it?

You can fix it yourself :).

There are a couple of ways:
- Download (`git clone`) the repository, make the necessary edits in the
`timetable.yml` file and then send a pull request.

- If you aren't familiar with git and don't want to do it locally, you
can `fork` this repository, make necessary changes to the file on the
github website itself and then submit a pull request all without
leaving the browser.

- If you really can't figure out how to do it, create an issue to list
  what change you want to make and someone will make it for you.

- Reach out to your class CR to do it for you.
